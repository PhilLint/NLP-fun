# NLP-fun
Overview of my NLP endeavours

In this project, I want to introduce you to all kinds of NLP adventures, I have taken on either as part of my Bachelor Thesis or part time job. It focusses on Machine Learning Techniques to either identify Topics within Text in an unsupervised, or supervised way primarily implemented in R but also Python. I briefly mention the gist of each project on this site with a more extensive description within the folders. 

## Translate crawled text data into English

In order to build one, universally applicable dataset to then base models for similar projects, we crawled one particular website, which entails texts in the same domain as our projects. As those were in German, a possibly free translation was sought. As we only rely on statistical patterns and not semantical correctness, Googletranslate would suffice just fine. Then I came across 
* [googletrans](https://github.com/ssut/py-googletrans) - Python package to allow the access to translation and also language detection.
